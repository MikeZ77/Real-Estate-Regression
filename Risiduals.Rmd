# Risidual Analysis


Five important assumptions need to hold so that the regression model can be useful for hypothesis testing and predication. These are:

1. The relationship between the response y and the regression is linear (at least approximately).

Why? This one is fairly obvious. If we are trying to explain some data using a linear model, then in order for it to be effective, there needs to be a linear relation present.

2. The error term $\epsilon$ has zero mean.
3. The error term $\epsilon$ has constant variance $\sigma^{2}$.
4. The errors are uncorrelated.
5. The errors are normally distributed.
